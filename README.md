## Overview

### Algorithms and Data Structures

- **Adiar**

  Presentations related to my PhD research project,
  [Adiar](https://github.com/SSoelvsten/adiar/).

  - **Core**: Basics of I/O-efficient BDD manipulation.
  - **ZDD**: Extension to support ZDDs.
  - **Cuts**: Upper bounds on memory demands via. graph theory.
  - **Nested Sweeping**: Algorithm to make multi-variable BDD quantification I/O-efficient.
  - **RelProd**: Relational Product for the model checking use-case.
  - **Verified**: Sketch of how to redo all of Adiar as pure, tail-recursive, and provably correct
    functional algorithms.

- **Anatree**

  An introduction to the Anagram tree (as a hidden introduction to BDDs)

- **I/O-Efficient Computation**

  An introduction to I/O-efficient algorithms and data structures.

### Algorithmic Game Theory

- **SSMG Complexity**

  Presentation that covers complexity results derived and published in
  collaboration with Kristoffer Arnsfelt Hansen.

### Type Theory

- **MLightDP**

  Presentation of the [MLightDP](https://github.com/SSoelvsten/mlightdp/)
  project I did in collaboration with Anna Mie Hansen as part of the
  *Language-based Security* MSc course by Aslan Askarov.

### Other

- **One Minute Madness**

  A single slide for me to present myself and my research.
