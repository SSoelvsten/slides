  - **Nested Sweeping**: Algorithm to make the multi-recursive BDD operations I/O-efficient.

- **I/O-Efficient Computation**

  An introduction to I/O-efficient algorithms and data structures.

### Algorithmic Game Theory

- **SSMG Complexity**

  Presentation that covers the complexity results I derived together with
