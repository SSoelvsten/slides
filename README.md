## Guidelines on Public Speaking

The notes below are based on courses on I have taken on public speaking and
conversationsI have had about the topic. You may notice, that these notes are
contradictory - this is due to different schools of thought. I will leave it up
to you to make up your own mind; but, please do not take that as an excuse to
find the "school of thought" that reinforces your current *bad habits*.

### Ashley Pearcy Buitenwerf

I (Steffan Sølvsten) can heavily recommend to take one or more of Buitenwerf's
courses. See [here](https://audienceandpurpose.com/) for more information; these
notes are nothing compared to taking her course.

#### Audience & Purpose

Your main goal is to incite curiosity, make them feel you are friends, not loose
them at any point, and you want them to be so very interested afterwards that
they (a) want to Google the subject, (b) read your paper or (c) chase you down
for some questions.

Hence, everything goes back to these two things: *Audience* and *Purpose*.

- **Audience**

  There are multiple pitfalls to look out for; they may have a background of
  non-belief ("skeptical") or might feel you are condescendingly talking down to
  them. Your choice of words can be important to not run into any such issue.

  It's about more than you - it should not be "see what I did!". You can (and may
  want to) pinpoint your target in a mixed crowd. Sure, try to get everyone on
  board (definitely do not alienate anyone), but it is ok if you primarily want
  to target a specific kind of person.

  Think about how they would want to hear the information.

- **Purpose**

  Think about the broader reasoning behind why you are giving this talk:
  inform/teach, enthuse, sell, or enquire?

You need to identify yout audience and with that purpose of your talk, before
you do anything else.

#### Logical Flow

When preparing a talk, start by outlining the structure of your talk based on
the following template:

- Opening, i.e. the *Hook*
- Key Point(s?)
- Take Home Message (THM)

It is important for this step, that you do **not** do this in PowerPoint! Using
PowerPoint makes you focus on the visuals of the slide rather than the talk's
content. Instead, you want to expand these bullet points into an entire script
(yes, one that is a word-for-word transcript of what you intend to say).

- Include **[pause]** and other queues in the script. This way, a five minutes
  talk matches with 3/2 of an A4 page.
- Writing the script helps you identify the transition from one bullet point to
  another and whether their order actually makes sense.
- You may want to colour-code the script and the structure (above) to keep track
  of what is supposed to relate to what.
- While you write it, say it out loud. Otherwise, you end up having a script in
  "written" language rather than in "spoken" language, e.g. the sentence
  structure and choice of words are very different.

When expanding these points, you want to start with the THM, then the Opening,
and finally the key points.

- **Take Home Message**

   Your talk should have one single idea as its *take home message* (THM):
   - A *Call to Action*
   - The applicability of your research (rather than your research).

   Ask yourself these questions to identify the THM.
   - What do you want people to know when they leave? Remember, you can only be
     sure they leave with **one idea**.
   - How do you want them to feel? Yes, you want to manipulate people, so you
     want them to feel something about your one idea.
   - Does the THM link back to your your **opening**? If not, you probably have
     the wrong THM or even more likely the wrong Opening.
   - Is it clear, focused, simple, and hence memorable? Can you simplify it
     somehow, such that it is easier to remember.

- **Opening**

  You have about 45 seconds to sell your idea. During this amount of time, you
  have to convince them, they should listen. The rest of the talk should fall
  under the idea/topic presented here.

  To this end, you need to find some *hook* to start with. This should at most 3
  lines long; hopefully it is only a one-liner.

  - Ask a question
  - State something "provocative"
  - Tell a (relevant) joke. Remember to have a backup plan, if the joke does not
    land with the audience.
  - Incite curiousity
  - Tell a story
  - Shock

  Here, you may also want to have a *prop* or a *striking visual* as part of the
  hook. But most importantly, it should be authentic - otherwise there is a wall
  between you and your audience.

  **Tip:** Think about taking an improv class.

- **Key Point(s)**

  These are the main ideas that are supposed to help guide the audience from the
  *opening* to the *take home message*. Every key point should narrow down the
  focus towards the *take home message*. Try *not* to go onto a side tangent;
  the audience will be stuck there and you may not be able to get back.

  You should try to identify the minimal number of key points needed to support
  your THM. If you can do without one, then remove it.

#### Visual Aid

When done with the script, you finally know what needs to be on the slides.
Note, a single slide has at most 1 point - so use more slides, if your script
calls for it.

A brain cannot both process visuals and audio. So, your visual aids are
**always** in conflict with the attention to your words. So, only ever have
something on that supports your current point.

- **Obvious No-go's**

  - Do not put a lot of stuff on your screen.

  - Do not have irrelevant information. If you say "ignore this", then just
    remove it. This also goes to plots and flow charts. Remove it, if you do not
    actually use it.

  - Do not have blurry images.

  - If you use a pointer, do not just quickly flash it on the screen, but
    instead make sure it lingers (yes, that is what we naturally do).

- **Less Obvious No-go's**

  - Bright contrast (especially bright text on dark backgrounds)

  - Font selection matters (just read papers on what font to use for reading on
    large screens)

  - Slowly revealing a slide can be dangerous, as the audience might be
    analysing the progress.

  - While you are teaching, you probably do not have to think too much about
    images and their copyright. But, when it gets official, you need to think
    about it. A good place to find open-source images is _Wiki Commons_.

- **Less Obvious Do's**

  - You can have endless fun and frustration by changing colour palettes, fonts,
    and infographics based on your audience and setting.
    - For example, the AU slides are a bit too formal for speaking to high
      school students.

#### Style and Delivery

There are multiple ways in which we can manipulate the audience to help guide
their attention.

- **Mind Games**

  - *Tone*: The tone (and your body language) you use can be used to incite a
    desired feeling. So, you need to think about how you deliver it as much as
    what you say.

    While people should always be able to hear you, you can get extra attention
    by *altering your volume*.

  - *Pause*: As mentioned, put pauses directly into your script. During
    delivery, count "*1, 2, 3*" in your head. It will be awkward, but the
    adrenalin makes everything go faster anyway.

  - *Repetition*: Your main point (or some catch-phrase) should be repeated. Of
    course, do not overdo it, but try to incorporate it.

    You do not want to repeat information in disguise, i.e. change the wording.

  - The *Blank Frame*: While it is merely a slide with nothing on it (not even
    the footer or header), it is one of the most powerful things you can use.
    The audience will have their entire focus on you and what you say.

    To this end, the `\blankframe` is part of my *LaTeX* preamble.

  - *Movement*: Switche the state of your movement (moving around on stage or
    hand-movements). For example, if you walk a lot, then stop when you state an
    important point.

    Even on Zoom you can still speak with your hands.

    - *Eye Contact*: Direct eye contact (or fake it by looking between people)
      creates engagement.

      Breaking eye contact can be used to put weight onto a topic.

    - *Pointing*: Pointing with a finger is for a _single person_ while with an
      open hand can be interpreted as _everyone_.

  - *Rule of Three*: We remember better if something comes in a package of 3.
  For example, "X provides A, B, and C". In this case, it is also good to
  visually count 1,2,3 with your fingers.

  If you have more than three points it can feel overwhelming. If you have fewer
  it feels less important. Hence, either prune down to three or come up with one
  extra point to get the magical three.

- **Voice**

  - *Speed*: Be slow... yes sloooooow!

    You need to break the language/accent barrier and overcome hearing problems.
    Furthermore, being blasted with information is hard to consume. Also, you
    usually are faster during the presentation.

  - *Volume and Projection*

    These two things are not the same. Please always project. Furthermore,
    always use a microphone - only in smaler rooms is no microphone a good idea.

  - *Enunciate*

    Finish your words before going to the next - overdo this in practice. If you
    have a heavy accent or there is a word you struggle with, practice it where
    you _really overdo it_ - or use a synonym.

  - *Confidence*

    Speak with confidence (even if you do not have it). There are ways you can
    try and fool your brain into having more confidence. For example,
    acknowledge that judgement probably does not exist or does not matter.

- **Taking the Stage**

  You can have your hands in your pockets, but you need to pull your shoulders
  back such that you still have an "open" body language. Better is only one hand
  in a pocket or even better both hands out of your pockets.

  The most important thing is to have an "open" body language such that you
  don't shut out the audience: roll your shoulders back before going in.

  Yet, forcing yourself to use your hands is worse than putting them in your
  pockets.

  - *Walk the Talk*

    Remember the pause before starting your talk.

Furthermore, be on the lookout for "bad words" and *ticks*, e.g. "So, ..." and
"Ehm, ..." .

### Bjarne Stroustrup

#### Abstract Slide
Create a slide with an *Abstract*. This way you have the text to advertise for
the talk and a way to guide you on what to say. Hide this *abstract* slide.

#### Opening Slide
Your opening slide should cover why they should bother to listen. What are they
going to learn based on your talk? Having a picture or two usually is a good
idea (in general even on most slides).

#### Points / Content

To this end, prepare your talk with your audience in mind (if possible). What
are their problems and their interest?

- For every point of the your talk, do (apply recursively if needed):
  1. Say what you are going to say.
  2. Say it. Do so clearly - do not beat about the bush; people differ and so
     getting an idea into people's head requires work.
  3. Say what you just said.

- What should be in the talk/slides and what should not?
  1. If you read from your slides, you have too much information on it.
  2. Make sure your main points are articulated on the slides and are not just
     something you say.
  3. To truly convey a major point to the audience you need *both* the
     rule/principle *and* an example. Only having one without the other does not
     work.
  4. In general, keep things simple. Except you have to have at least one
     example to "blind them with science". That is, you need some part that they
     do not understand. This is to show depth of understanding and to establish
     you as an expert/authority.

- One of the best ways to get a point across is to tell a story or an anecdote.
  Here, you should present it as a sequence of (concrete) actions.
  - You may want to ask questions - rhetorical or even the real ones where you
    hope for an answer from the audience.
  - Make sure you reflect on the point. What is the implications of it?

- Never forget the acknowledgements. If in doubt about who to acknowledge, be
  genourous. In fact, front-load the acknowledgements such that you do not miss
  them at the end.

- Final Slide should include
  1. Key Points, Future Directions.
  2. References to more information, e.g. your website and/or email.
  3. If you have space, add an (upbeat) picture.

#### Slides
Keep your slides simple!

1. No fancy backgrounds or transitions; otherwise, you will look like a
   salesman.
2. Do not have too much information on one slide. Information should not be
   treated equally; instead, assume your audience can find the extra
   information if needed. Having 7 +/- 1 point per slide is a good rule of
   thumb.
3. Do not have two unrelated points on the same slide.
4. Keep a consistent style throughout, both in terms of the graphics and the
   amount of information.
5. Minimize the number of acronyms (and if you do have some, remember to fully
   articulate them when presenting)
6. Use a suitable font (18+p for all readers). Also consider the resolution of
   the projector.
7. Illustrations are great, but take care:
   - Remember to label your axes on plots.
   - Only use a *moderate* number of colours.
   - Short movies are great. This especially applies to demos, since a "live
     demonstration" in practice often goes wrong. If you really want to do a
     live demo, you have to rehearse it often.
   - Do not rely on a web connection.

#### Other Things

- Humour is good. But, it is also dangerous since homour does not translate well.

- Remember to label your slides, such that people can refer to a slide number
  for their questions.

- Be sure to have clear and simple examples.

- Change type of slides - do not have all the code slides grouped together.
  This helps with breaking the monotony of the talk.

- Be sure your presentation is 100% ready when you have to go: the projector
  might have problems turning on or connecting to your laptop, you may have to
  set up the IDE for your live demo, your phone may not be switched off.

- Do finish on time (except if you are interrupted by many questions and
  comments)! So practice your talk and time it.

### Jaco van de Pol

- Include the slide number on all slides
- Include a *table of content* slide at the beginning, in-between of each key
  point/topic, and possibly also the end. This is to help the audience keep
  track of where we are in the talk, and the direction things are going.

### Marijn Heule

- Include your *name*, *email*, and/or *website* on each slide of the
  presentation; e.g. the footer. This especially applies to cases like special
  seminars, where you want people to remember you.
